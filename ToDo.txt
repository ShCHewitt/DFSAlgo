ToDo: 12/5

Reachable:
 - Make a map of each team and which players are currently on that team. (could be web scraping)
 - Set start percentages of each player.

 - Add outputs for the rankings of each player in each sort, we could then weigh where each player stands in each stat as a value and then sort that.

 - List out all of the things we want to include in the algorithm to score players on a given night.
 - Figure out how we want to score them and how we want to weigh each one.
 - In algorithm we could include a constant on if they are starting or not based on each player.




Web Scraping: 
 - Make a map of teams.
 - Scrape the web / Buy a data set for the games that have been played thus far in the year to get up to date stats.
 - Get schedules of teams.
 - Make map of the injured players of teams.
 - Compare the maps of injured players and team roster to make another map of eligible players.
 - Give the program the current date, then scrape the web for the games on the given date.


Beyond the current scope:
 - Make a user interface GUI that could be input into a website.
 - 


Optimization:
 - Backlog the algorithm to test it (will be free).
