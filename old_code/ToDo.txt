ToDo: 12/7

Reachable:
 - Rank which teams have the lowest average ranking in the consistency sort.
 - Simplify the inputs of the console sort function, only need to input the Map.
 - Create a display method for the team rankings.

 - Draw out an image for what we want the GUI to look like and the things that we want it to do.
 - Code the baseline for the GUI.

 - Figure out how to write data to the exact specifications of the csv file that we currently have for the current season.
 - See if we can do this for the season thus far.
 - See if we can continue to update the data up until the current date.

 - Read through the excel files from the python file to make a map of each teams schedule throughout the season Map<String, ArrayList<String>>

this is later: and important.
 - List out all of the things we want to include in the algorithm to score players on a given night.

 - Figure out how we want to score them and how we want to weigh each one.
 - In algorithm we could include a constant on if they are starting or not based on each player.


 - Put the display function into a GUI.



Web Scraping: 
 - Make a map of teams.
 - Scrape the web / Buy a data set for the games that have been played thus far in the year to get up to date stats.
 - Get schedules of teams.
 - Make map of the injured players of teams.
 - Compare the maps of injured players and team roster to make another map of eligible players.
 - Give the program the current date, then scrape the web for the games on the given date.


Beyond the current scope:

 - Make a user interface GUI that could be input into a website.
 - Finish the GUI.


Optimization:
 - Backlog the algorithm to test it (will be free). :)
